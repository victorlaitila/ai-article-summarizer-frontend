# AI Article Summarizer Frontend

This is the React + Vite frontend for the AI Article Summarizer project.
It provides a user interface to summarize articles using the backend API.

Backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/victorlaitila/ai-article-summarizer-backend)

## Live Demo
The app is live here: [AI Article Summarizer](https://victorlaitila.github.io/ai-article-summarizer-frontend/)

NOTE: the demo uses a mock server with static data and does not call the actual backend API in order to avoid deployment costs.

## Features
- Enter the article content (URL/free text/file) to get the full article and a summarized version
- Choose between different summarization modes:
  - Default (balanced summary)
  - Bullet points
  - Simplified (short and simple summary)
- Keywords are generated based on the article content and these can be highlighted in the text
- Both the article and summary have text-to-speech functionality
- Article summaries can be copied, shared and downloaded
